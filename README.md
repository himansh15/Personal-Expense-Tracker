# Personal-Expense-Tracker-Project

This project is a full-stack web application that helps users track their income and expenses in real time. It allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal finances through an intuitive dashboard. The application supports secure user authentication, data storage, and visualization of financial statistics.

This is full stack development project where, I have used React.js, Nodejs, ExpressJs and MongoDB for database server.
